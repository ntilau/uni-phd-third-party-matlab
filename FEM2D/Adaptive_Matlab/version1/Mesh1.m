%  The Fem package uses a structure to describe a
%  triangular mesh. This structure contains a number
%  of arrays, as described below.  The following notation
%  is used to describe the arrays:
%
%       Nt: the number of triangles
%       T_1,T_2,...,T_{Nt}: the triangles
%
%       Nv: the number of nodes
%       z_1,z_2,...,z_{Nv}: the nodes
%
%       Nf: the number of free nodes
%       Nc: the number of constrained nodes
%
%       Ne: the number of edges
%       e_1,e_2,...,e_{Ne}: the edges
%
%       Nb: the number of free boundary edges
%
%  Here are the arrays describing the mesh:
%
%       Degree: Integer. The degree of the elements
%               (1=linear, 2=quadratic, etc.)
%
%       Elements: Nt by 3 array.  The ith row contains
%                 pointers into Edges, identifying the
%                 three edges of T_i, in counterclockwise
%                 order, and their orientations. Specifically,
%                 suppose Elements(i,j)=k.  If k>0, then
%                 the jth edge of T_i is e_k, traced from
%                 its first endpoint to its second.  If k<0,
%                 then the jth edge of T_i is e_{-k}, traced
%                 from its second endpoint to its first.
%
%       Edges: Ne by 2 array. The ith row contains pointers
%              into Nodes, identifying the endpoints of e_i.
%
%       EdgeEls: Ne by 2 array. The ith row contains pointers
%                into Elements, identifying the triangles on
%                either side of e_i. (If e_i is a constrained
%                boundary edge, the second pointer is zero. If
%                e_i is a free boundary edge, the second pointer
%                is the negative of its index in FBndyEdges.)
%
%       EdgeCFlags: Ne by 1 array. The ith entry is 1 if e_i is
%                   curved, and zero otherwise.
%
%       Nodes: Nv by 2 array.  The ith row contains the (x,y)
%              coordinates of z_i.
%
%       NodePtrs: Nv by 1 array.  If z_i is free, then
%                 NodePtrs(i) is the index of the node in
%                 FNodePtrs.  If z_i is constrained, then
%                 NodePtrs(i) is the negative of the index of
%                 the node in CNodePtrs.
%
%       FNodePtrs: Nf by 1 array.  The ith entry is the index
%                  in Nodes of the ith free node.
%
%       CNodePtrs: Nc by 1 array.  The ith entry is the index in
%                  Nodes of the ith constrained node.
%
%       FBndyEdges: Nb by 1 array. The ith entry is the index of
%                   in Edges of the ith free boundary edge.
%
%  Optional: (added automatically by Refine1)
%
%       LevelNodes: k by 1 array, where Refine1 has been applied
%                   k-1 times.  The nodes added during the ith
%                   refinement are numbered
%                      LevelNodes(i)+1,...,LevelNodes(i+1).
%                   If LevelNodes does not exist, then k is taken
%                   to be 1 and LevelNodes(1) is taken to be Nv.
%
%       NodeParents: Nv by 2 array.  If node z_i was obtained by
%                    refinement as the midpoint of the edge with
%                    endpoints z_j and z_k, then
%                          NodeParents(i,:)=[j,k].
%                    Otherwise,
%                          NodeParents(i,:)=[i,0].
